# Openhouse Videos

This repository stores a list of video links from the OpenHouse24 YouTube channel. The fact that all videos have the property of being filmed with a moving camera, while the scene itself is relatively static, renders the videos viable to be used as training data for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation.
